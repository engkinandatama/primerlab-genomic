# PrimerLab Preset: Diagnostic PCR
# Optimized for clinical/diagnostic applications with high specificity
# v0.7.3

workflow: pcr
preset: diagnostic_pcr

# Description: Diagnostic PCR requires highly specific primers with
# stringent conditions to avoid false positives in clinical settings.

parameters:
  # Primer size - slightly longer for higher specificity
  primer_size:
    min: 20
    opt: 22
    max: 28
  
  # Melting temperature - tighter range for consistency
  tm:
    min: 58.0
    opt: 60.0
    max: 62.0
  
  # GC content - well-balanced
  gc:
    min: 45.0
    max: 55.0
  
  # Amplicon size - shorter for faster runs
  product_size_range: [[80, 200]]
  
  # Specificity settings
  max_self_complementarity: 6
  max_poly_x: 3
  max_3_prime_stability: 9.0

# QC settings - stricter for diagnostics
