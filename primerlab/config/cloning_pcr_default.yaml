# PrimerLab Preset: Cloning PCR
# Optimized for molecular cloning with restriction sites

workflow: pcr
preset: cloning_pcr

# Description: Cloning PCR produces amplicons suitable for ligation
# into vectors. Primers often include restriction sites at 5' ends.

parameters:
  # Primer size - longer to accommodate restriction sites
  primer_size:
    min: 25
    opt: 30
    max: 40
  
  # Melting temperature - higher for added bases
  tm:
    min: 58.0
    opt: 62.0
    max: 68.0
  
  # GC content - strict for stability
  gc:
    min: 40.0
    max: 60.0
  
  # Amplicon size - variable for cloning targets
  product_size_range: [[200, 3000]]
  
  # Specificity settings - relaxed for added tails
  max_self_complementarity: 10
  max_poly_x: 4
  max_3_prime_stability: 9.0

# QC settings
